# Review: Permissions page keys (ut-docs#3132)

**Date:** 2026-09-28 · Built by Opus 5.5 · Reviewed by Fable (independent)

Adds the 33 keys core added in universaltill/universal-till#1504: the Permissions page's group headings, a one-line description of each action, and the "Unlocks: %s" line with its separator. The manifest version is bumped so the pack ships.

The review found no blockers. It flagged terms that didn't match the rest of the pack, and all of them are fixed. German: the drawer sentence says "Kassenschublade" (the diff otherwise uses "Kasse" for the till), "Backoffice-Ansicht", and "Kontrollkästchen". The pack keeps formal "Sie". Keys that are the same as English on purpose are added to the `same-as-en` allowlist, including the `", "` separator. `validate.sh`, `check-key-drift.sh` (0 drift) and `check-key-drift.test.sh` pass.
