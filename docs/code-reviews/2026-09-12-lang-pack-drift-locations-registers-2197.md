# Code review: `locations.*`/`registers.*` record_dialog keys (ut-docs#2197)

**Branch:** `fix/2197-lang-pack-drift`
**Author:** Farshid Mirza (pipeline, `lane:cloud-NN`*)
**Card:** universaltill/ut-docs#2197

\* this cycle's own routine prompt carried an unfilled template
placeholder for the lane id instead of a real one — see the cycle's
closing comment on the card for detail. Noted here only so a future
reader doesn't mistake it for a made-up label.

## What changed

Card ut-docs#2197 was filed after `ut-plugin-language-{de,es}`'s own
`scripts/check-key-drift.sh` was found failing against `universal-till`
main: core's Locations admin screen was ported to the shared
`record_dialog`/`list_header` UI pattern (ut-docs#2124,
universal-till#1129), and this pack was never updated to match.

**Scope widened during Dev, not just at pick-up.** By the time this cycle
picked the card up, `universal-till` main had *also* gained the identical
record_dialog port for the Registers admin screen
(`fix/2185-registers-record-dialog`, merged after ut-docs#2197 was filed)
— an independent, unrelated PR that introduced the exact same key shape
under `registers.*`. Fixing only the `locations.*` keys the card
literally listed would have left `check-key-drift.sh` — and this card's
own stated acceptance criterion ("`check-key-drift.sh` should report 0
drift against core's main afterward") — still failing. So this fix covers
both domains in one pass rather than filing a second follow-up card for
something already in scope of "make the drift check pass."

- `locales/de.json`: added `locations.{create,edit,empty,new,
  search_placeholder,deactivate_confirm}` and the identical six keys
  under `registers.*`, in strict alphabetical position. Removed the six
  now-orphaned old-dialog keys: `locations.{new.submit,new.title,rename}`
  and `registers.{new.submit,new.title,rename}` — confirmed absent from
  core's `en.json` (not merely stale-in-the-pack; core genuinely doesn't
  emit them any more, so this is not a regression).
- `manifest.json`: `1.1.68` → `1.1.69` (this repo's own rule — any PR
  touching a shipped file must bump the version, enforced by
  `scripts/check-version-bump.sh`).

## Translation decisions

Matched against `categories.*` — the closest existing sibling in the same
record_dialog key family (`create`/`edit`/`empty`/`new`/
`search_placeholder`/`deactivate_confirm`), already translated in this
pack:

- `locations.create` / `registers.create` → **"Standort anlegen"** /
  **"Kassenplatz anlegen"** — reuses the exact wording the now-removed
  `locations.new.submit` / `registers.new.submit` already had (same
  action, new key name only), so no new decision was actually needed here.
- `*.edit` → **"Standort bearbeiten"** / **"Kassenplatz bearbeiten"**,
  following `categories.edit` → "Kategorie bearbeiten" (noun + infinitive,
  no "Sie").
- `*.new` → **"Neuer Standort"** / **"Neuer Kassenplatz"** — again a
  direct carry-over of the removed `*.new.title` values.
- `*.search_placeholder` → **"Standorte durchsuchen"** / **"Kassenplätze
  durchsuchen"**, following `categories.search_placeholder` →
  "Kategorien durchsuchen" (plural noun + "durchsuchen").
- `*.empty` → **"Noch keine Standorte — tippen Sie auf +, um einen
  anzulegen."** / **"Noch keine Kassenplätze — tippen Sie auf +, um einen
  anzulegen."**, following `categories.empty`'s exact template ("Noch
  keine {plural} — tippen Sie auf +, um {pronoun} anzulegen."). Both
  "Standort" and "Kassenplatz" are masculine, so the accusative pronoun is
  "einen" in both — same as the German original would need if it were
  "eine Kategorie" was feminine and used "eine" (checked: it does).
- `*.deactivate_confirm` → **"Diesen Standort deaktivieren? Sie können ihn
  später wieder aktivieren."** / **"Diesen Kassenplatz deaktivieren? Sie
  können ihn später wieder aktivieren."** Modeled on
  `categories.deactivate_confirm` ("Diese Kategorie deaktivieren? Ihre
  Artikel behalten ihre Zuordnung und Sie können sie später wieder
  aktivieren.") but trimmed to match the *simpler* English source
  template shared by `locations`/`registers` ("Deactivate this X? You can
  reactivate it later." — no items-keep-their-assignment clause, unlike
  `categories`'/`catalog.delete_confirm_named`'s longer version). Both
  nouns masculine → accusative "diesen" and object pronoun "ihn" (matching
  `categories`' feminine "diese"/"sie" pattern by grammatical gender, not
  literal reuse).

## Verified

- `bash scripts/validate.sh` — `ok com.universaltill.language-de v1.1.69 (de)`.
- `UT_CORE_EN_JSON=<local universal-till>/web/locales/en.json bash
  scripts/check-key-drift.sh` — `ok -- 2362/2365 core keys translated,
  3 known-untranslated (baseline), 78 known-same-as-English (allowlist),
  0 drift, 0 orphans, 0 empty values, 0 untranslated-present, 0 token
  mismatches`.
- `bash scripts/check-version-bump.sh` — `ok: manifest.json version
  bumped 1.1.68 -> 1.1.69, covering: locales/de.json, manifest.json`.
- None of the 12 new keys appear in `i18n-baseline/de.untranslated.txt` or
  `i18n-baseline/de.same-as-en.txt` — brand-new translated keys, no
  baseline pruning owed.
- `git diff --stat` against `origin/main`: exactly `locales/de.json` and
  `manifest.json` touched, nothing else. Key count 2356 → 2362 (+12 added,
  −6 removed), still strictly alphabetically sorted, no duplicate keys.
- Did not additionally run core's `scripts/ci/check-lang-pack-drift.sh`
  (the raw-fetch-and-re-run-the-pack's-own-script proxy core CI uses) —
  that script fetches each pack's *pushed* `main`, which this unmerged
  branch isn't yet, and it invokes exactly the same
  `check-key-drift.sh` already run directly above against core's real,
  current `en.json`. Re-implementing its raw-fetch-override plumbing for
  this small, contained diff would verify the same thing a second way,
  not a different thing.

## Independent review

Reviewed by a fresh-context Sonnet subagent (per `complexity:easy`
routing), briefed to independently re-derive every added translation
against core's `en.json`, check grammatical gender/case agreement against
the `categories.*` precedent, confirm the six removed keys are genuinely
orphaned (not still emitted by core), re-run all four guard scripts
itself rather than trust this record, verify alphabetical key order and
literal (non-escaped) UTF-8, and check for collateral changes.

Verdict: **no blockers, no should-fix items, no nits.** It independently
confirmed masculine gender/case agreement on both new nouns, confirmed
punctuation/tone match to `categories.empty`'s template, re-ran
`check-key-drift.sh`/`validate.sh`/`check-version-bump.sh` and got
identical clean results, and confirmed via `git diff --name-only
origin/main` that only the two intended files changed.
