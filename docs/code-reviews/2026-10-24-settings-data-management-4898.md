# Review — pointer strings name the "Datenverwaltung" section (ut-docs#4898)

- **Date:** 2026-10-24 · **Built by:** Opus 5.5 · **Reviewed by:** Sonnet 5.5, fresh context
- **Scope:** the values of ten existing keys (`elevation.summary.data_reset_transactions`, `import.sample.{already_loaded,help,present,settings_link}`, `import.welcome.sample.body`, `settings.data.{demo_item_has_history,demo_kept_reason_history,reset_done}`, `settings.language.install_unavailable`) now name this locale's `settings.data.title` instead of the short "Data" form. No keys were added or removed. Version bumped to 1.1.269. This is the pack half of universal-till's `fix/4898-settings-data-management`.
- **Checks:** `scripts/validate.sh` passes. `scripts/check-key-drift.sh` passes against core `main`'s en.json and against the branch's en.json (3675/3675, 0 drift, 0 token mismatches). The reviewer confirmed placeholders are intact and the grammar is correct.
- **Findings:** none.
- **Verdict:** safe to merge.
