# Code review: translate 1 new go-to-Modifiers key

- **Card:** universaltill/ut-docs#2379 — a "Go to Modifiers to create a
  group" link on the core `universal-till` side
  (`universaltill/universal-till#1286`, merged as `d6ff55b0`). This is a
  brand-new core key with no prior German translation to fall behind on.
  `main`'s `lang-pack-drift` check (blocking on push) flagged this pack
  as drifted right after the core PR merged, naming both
  `ut-plugin-language-de` and `ut-plugin-language-es` explicitly.
- **Repo:** `ut-plugin-language-de`
- **Reviewer:** self-reviewed inline (same session as the core change) —
  a small, mechanical, same-cycle language-pack follow-up, not a separate
  board card; verified live against the repo's own guards.

## What shipped

One new key, added to `locales/de.json` next to its alphabetical
neighbour, matching this file's existing formal **Sie** register and the
same "Extras" terminology this pack already uses for "Modifiers"
elsewhere in the same block (`catalog.modifiers.manage` = "Extras
verwalten", `catalog.modifiers.title` = "Extras"):

- `catalog.modifiers.go_to_modifiers` → "Zu Extras wechseln, um eine
  Gruppe zu erstellen"

Not identical to its English source, so no
`i18n-baseline/de.same-as-en.txt` allowlist entry is needed.

`manifest.json`'s version bumped `1.1.99` → `1.1.100`, per this repo's
own `CLAUDE.md` shipped-file convention.

## Review findings

None (no must-fix).

Verified, live, not just read:

- `bash scripts/validate.sh` — exit 0: `ok com.universaltill.language-de
  v1.1.100 (de)`.
- `UT_CORE_EN_JSON=/home/user/universal-till/web/locales/en.json bash
  scripts/check-key-drift.sh` (pointed at core's actual merged `main`,
  `d6ff55b0`, which carries the new key) — exit 0: **2590/2590 core keys
  translated, 0 drift, 0 orphans, 0 empty values, 0 untranslated-present,
  0 token mismatches.**
- No format/placeholder tokens in the English source string, none
  invented on the German side.
- No real client/shop name, no secret-shaped literal.
- Git identity on the commit verified against the pipeline owner's
  GitHub-linked address before the first commit in this freshly-cloned
  repo, per the `scrum-master` skill's mid-cycle repo-attach rule.

## Verdict

**Safe to merge** — this is the fix for `universal-till` `main`'s
currently-red `lang-pack-drift` check (blocking on push, per this
ecosystem's standing i18n rules). `merge_method: "merge"`.
