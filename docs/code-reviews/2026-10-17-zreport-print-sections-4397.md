# Review: 32 printed Z-report keys (de), ut-docs#4397

This change translates the 32 `reports.zpaper.*` keys that universal-till
added for ut-docs#4397. Those keys cover the printed end-of-day report's
departments, tills, ÖKC block, article/operator/order-type sections, voucher
and void lines, cash reconciliation, receipt range and legacy period line. It
also bumps `manifest.json` to 1.1.256.

**Reviewer:** Sonnet 5.5, an independent pass (the author model was Opus 5.5).
Findings fixed before commit:
- Terminology was aligned with this pack's existing on-screen and shift keys:
  - de: Warengruppe, Kassierer, and the German manual's cash vocabulary;
  - es: "tiques", "Cierre de día", "… de caja";
  - pt: "numerário", "… de caixa", "Utilizados".
- Clumsy ÖKC tender labels were shortened.
- Ambiguous bare "Entradas"/"Salidas" were made explicit.

**Verified:**
- Every value is within the key's `max_length` (row labels 20, the STORNOS
  note 31, the multi-Z hint 30). Placeholders keep the English order.
- `scripts/validate.sh` passes.
- `scripts/check-key-drift.sh` against core's branch `en.json`: 0 drift,
  0 orphans, 0 token mismatches.

**Verdict:** safe to merge once universal-till's ut-docs#4397 change is on
`main`.
