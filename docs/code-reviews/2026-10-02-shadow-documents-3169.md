# Review: shadow-mode customer-document keys (ut-docs#3169)

**Change:** six new keys from universal-till#1573 (ADR-0124: the sell-screen
shadow banner, the 451 refusal, the Sale recorded card, the read-only Country
settings column), plus the two `permissions.action*.personal_display` keys
from universal-till d6fa6648b that no pack PR carried (they were failing
`key-drift` on every pack PR and `lang-pack-drift` on core `main`).
Merges `main` and bumps the patch version.

**Reviewer:** independent model (Sonnet, not the author), 2026-10-02.

Checked against the English source: meaning and omissions; register
(Sie-form; „Verkaufsbildschirm“ and „Design“ match the pack's existing terms); no placeholder tokens needed; no certification claim.

**Findings:** none.

**Checks:** every core `en.json` key at universal-till `e5d75d7a` is present
in `locales/de.json`; the JSON parses.
